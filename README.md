# A State Web Portal for Women Sexual Harassment at Workplace

By creating a web portal where women lodge their complaints, track
their complaints, and seek help in the same regards from a panel of
designated people.

The platform also provides insights into what sexual harassment is
and how to identify it, and what crucial steps to be taken if it
happens. It would also provide how fellow employers can help in the
prevention.
